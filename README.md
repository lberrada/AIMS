# AIMS : Autonomous Intelligent Machines &amp; Systems
Repository for the first year courses of the AIMS program

List of implementations:

Gaussian Process Regression  
Belief Propagation Algorithm  
Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Bayesian Linear Regression and for Gaussian Mixture models  
Auto-Regressive Model  
Auto-Correlated Model  
Kalman Filter (ongoing)  

NB: Some of the code is simply converted from Matlab (original: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/teaching/AIMS_CDT_ML_2015/homework/index.html)
